# odin-calculator

This is a basic calculator built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course.
The project demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating a functional web calculator that can handle basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Clear (AC) and Backspace (C) functionality
- Invert numbers (positive/negative toggle)
- Percent calculation
- Responsive design using Flexbox

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the calculator interface
- **CSS**: Styling and layout using Flexbox for responsiveness
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation for interactive functionality

## Future Improvements

- Multi-operation support (e.g., `4 + 3 * 2`)
- Improved formatting for negative numbers (displaying with parentheses)
